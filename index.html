			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

      <figure>
				<img src="PopulationByDemographic.png" alt="Male and Female Populations 1900 and 2000" />
				<figcaption>
					Male and Female populations for each age group in the years 1900 and 2000
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this sketch I aimed to highlight how much populations had changed between 2000 and 1900, to both see how populations varied between the two times and between the sexes in each time.</li>
				<li>Colored dots were used to make it easier to distinguish groups with overlapping or nearly overlapping values. </li>
				<li>Due to the large difference it was difficult to find a scale which would keep the data readable for both groups, which when coupled with using permanent methods in line with the assignment resulted in more data being off of the page than I would have otherwise liked from a design perspective.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="MagnitudeOfPopulationChange.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
          Magnitude of change in populations of males and females for each age group between 1900 and 2000. ex. a population in 2000 that was 300% of that in 1900 would have a magnitude of 3.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>While the first sketch highlighted that the population was much greater in 2000 than in 1900, I wanted to better display the amount by which it had changed between the centuries for each demographic.</li>
				<li>Bars were used to provide an easy mental comparison of magnitudes and to illustrate just how much more significant the population increase was for larger groups. </li>
				<li>Male and female population changes are shown side by side within each age group, allowing the reader to see how they have changed individually over time as well as in relation to one another.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="PopulationAsPercentage.png" alt="Percentage of population within each age group" />
				<figcaption>
          Percentage that each age group comprises of their demographic population.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Up until now, total values were demonstrated which was useful for comparing age groups directly, however it did not give a good idea of how large each group was compared to the total population.</li>
				<li>Demonstrating the data in this way reveals less obvious information, such as how in 1900 the population density of each age group consistently drops.</li>
				<li>By connecting the dots the reader is able to more easily observe and compare the trends of each demographic.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The initial objective of plotting this data was to answer the simple question "How did population demographics change in the U.S. between the years 1900 and 2000".
		In arranging the data in different ways I hoped to see if any trends or patterns stood out that weren't immediately obvious.
		While some trends which emerged were expected, there were some surprises, such as the increase in the populations of those in their mid-30s to mid-50s.

			<h2>Phase Two: Final Design</h2>

				<figcaption>
					Percentage of males and females comprising total population, with explanations for certain trends based on data from the <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13707/w13707.pdf"> National Bureau of Economic Research</a> and <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2016/1/25/mortality-in-the-united-states-past-present-and-future">Penn Wharton University of Pennsylvania</a>.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        In my final graphic, I sought to explain the trends discovered in the previous graphic depicting age groups as a percentage of their demographics in order to explain the questions that arose from that data.
		While I could observe the change in population as a percent for each age group, this data was insufficent to determine whether these were caused by mortality, changes in birthrates or other external factors.
		I largely kept this chart the same from the third chart that I sketched, with the exception that I now took males and females as a percentage of the total population for their year, rather than the total of their year and sex.
		I felt that this graphic best depicted all of the information found in the three sketches and could be used to explain all of the trends found in my research. 
		</br>
		One comparison between the two centuries observed was the decline in population in early age groups in the year 1900 compared to 2000. I obtained <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2016/1/25/mortality-in-the-united-states-past-present-and-future">data from Penn Wharton University</a> and determined that this was likely related to the massively higher infant and child mortality rate in 1900.
		While the 1900 population perentages were smaller for each subsequent age group, the 2000 population percentages took a large jump for the 35 to 45 year groups. This was due to the so-called <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13707/w13707.pdf"> "Baby Boom" following WWII</a>.
		While it is common sense that there would be a larger amount of older individuals in the year 2000 compared to 1900 with increased life expectancies, to make the data visualization more complete I included the <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2016/1/25/mortality-in-the-united-states-past-present-and-future">mortality rates</a> to show how they contributed to this change.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Ultimately, sketching my data before creating my final graphic had a profound impact on my design choices. While I had a general and simple idea for an initial question to explore in my graphing of the provided data, it was through the experimentation and sketching that I developed more probing questions that directed me towards a more informational graphic and specific points of interest to research. The information and conclusions that I included in my annotations would not have stood out in the raw data as anomolous and worthy of specific inquiry from examining and sorting the raw data set, and as a result of probing those things which stood out from the sketches I was able to create a much more interesting and informative visualization.
